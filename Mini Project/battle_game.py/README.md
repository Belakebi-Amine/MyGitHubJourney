# ⚔️ Battle Game – My First Python Project  

Hello! 👋 My name is **Amine**, and this is one of my very first projects in Python.  
It’s a **simple turn-based battle game**, created to practice the basics of **functions, loops, and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**.  

I’m still learning, so the code is not perfect – but I’m proud of it because it’s a real step in my journey to become a better programmer. 🚀

## 🎮 Features
    - Create characters with:
    - Name
    - Health Points (HP)
    - Attack Power  
    - Attack your opponent with randomized damage 💥  
    - Heal yourself (but never go above max HP) ❤️‍🩹  
    - The game ends when one character’s HP drops to 0

## 🖥️ Example Gameplay
    Hero attacks Monster for 37 damage!
    Monster has 463 HP left.
    Monster attacks Hero for 42 damage!
    Hero has 258 HP left.
    Hero heals for 30 HP!
    Hero now has 288 HP.

## ⚙️ Requirements
    - Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.10, but newer versions should work fine)

---

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Belakebi-Amine/battle-game.git

2. Go inside the project folder:
    cd battle-game

3. Run the game:
    python battle_game.py

🌱 Why I Made This
    I’m learning Python step by step. This project helped me understand:

    How to create and use classes

    How to write methods like attack() and heal()

    How to make a simple game loop until someone wins

    It may look small, but for me it’s a big step. Next, I want to try:

    Different character types (Warrior, Mage, Healer…)

    Items and inventory

    Smarter enemy AI

    Maybe even a little RPG story 🏰

🙌 Notes
If you’re also learning Python, feel free to check the code and even suggest improvements.
I’d love feedback – I’m still a beginner, but I’m motivated to grow! 💡

Thanks for reading, and wish me luck on my journey! ✨
